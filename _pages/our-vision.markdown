## The App
Is there anything better than knowing the most updated rank of the best restaurants by dish in your favourite city?

Having it at hand!

Given the amount of work devoted to our project and the results obtained, we can't exempt ourselves from sharing it with people. After all, to get the full value of cuisine you must have someone to divide it with (Mark Twain in Italy eating carbonara).

It goes without saying that developing an app and making it available to people is the best way to share joyful things like italian dishes.

## Expanding the horizon

#### _Reinforcing loop_
The multifaceted horizon of cuisine needs to be properly treated and its exploration by statistical methods requires detailed precision. Such precision showed its necessity when we realized that the actual apps and website that offer a window to restaurants and host customers reviews do not give weight to experts knowledge of local cuisine.

On the contrary, the CraveIT app will enable people to authenticate as specialized users, such as food critics, so that the score associated to their reviews will receive a special weight in the final ranking. 


#### Image analysis
Appearance matters too, as many use to say, but not as a mere arrangement of colours and forms as in the food-pornographic capture of the physical aspect of dishes. Instead, the analysis of pictures taken by reviewers will provide additional accuracy to the ranking formula by conveying information about colours and texture, that can be compared to the information conveyed by certified pictures.

#### _Conquering the world_

The best way to make CraveIT useful is by expanding its geographical reach to Italy and beyond. For each city, we can identify typical dishes, flavors, tastes, and the most specialized restaurants, in order to offer users the best experience.

The actual proof of concept will be letting people verify the accuracy of our ranking.
