# **Future Plans**
### Our vision
<br>
As you have seen on the site, CraveIT is currently a **PoC**; as such, it is at present restricted to a specific town and a given set of dishes.
In this section, we express some **hopes and wishes** on its future.
<br>
<br>

### The App
Is there anything better than knowing the perfect restaurants for your favorite dish? Obviously, having the answer at the palm of your hand.

Given the amount of **work, love, and care** that we devoted to our project, and the results that it obtained, we can't wait to share it with people. After all, "to get the full value of cuisine you must have someone to divide it with" (with apologies to Mark Twain).
Of course, **developing an app** and making it available to the rest of the world is the best way of sharing joyful things, such as italian dishes.
In particular, CraveIT could be deployed as a stand-alone app, but also as an add-on to existing platforms.

### Expanding the horizon
<br>

#### Reinforcing loop

The detailed and statistical exploration of the food world can't start but in one place: collecting (more) data.
As clearly shown in the validation section, current food apps and websites are not fine-grained enough: they only take into account generic reviews about the users' eating experience, and they don't properly weight the opinion of local experts.
On the contrary, CraveIT will **enable customers to leave dish-specific reviews**.
<br>
Been to a place we suggested? Tell us whether the carbonara was the best you've ever tasted. Are you a local or a food critic? Get a **verified profile** on CraveIT and tip us on all the awesome places we still don't know about.

<br>

#### Image analysis
As the saying goes, appearance matters too. The color and texture **analysis of pictures** taken by casual diners and verified reviewers will greatly help with the accuracy of the ranking formula: just <i>how creamy</i> that carbonara really is?
Of course, in addition, by returning a restaurant ranking paired with pictures of the target dish, we will be able to provide our users with a realistic expectation of what they're in for.

<br>
#### Conquering the world

The best way to make CraveIT useful is by expanding its geographical reach to the **rest of Italy, and beyond**. For each city, we can identify its typical dishes and flavors, and direct our users to the perfect restaurants.
<br>
CraveIT represents a natural integration to the **turism** industry. Locals might already be familiar with the best spots in town, and have their personal opinionated ranking of those; the time users will need CraveIT the most is when they're visiting some place new.

So what's the best baklava in Istanbul? We hope, one day, CraveIT will know the answer.
