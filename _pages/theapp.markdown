# **The App**
## The idea

The 'CraveIT' app was designed by trying to identify restaurants that were best loved for their traditional food offerings. 
In particular, users will be able to know where to find the most beloved carbonara in Rome!
Users will be able to log in, decide what they want to eat, and based on the dish selected, the best restaurants will be recommended!


## How the app works

'CraveIT' allows you to select a dish of Roman cuisine and recommends the best restaurants based on the chosen dish. 
In addition, the user can decide to set a number of filters in order to have a more personalized response. 

The proposed results depend on the ristornati ranking algorithm at the base of the application, this takes into account many factors, including customer feedback, expert opinion, restaurant reliability and specialization of the analyzed restaurants.


#### Overview

'CraveIT' presents a simple overview page where you can search for the dish you want to try, just type the dish in the search bar and the app will suggest the full name of the dish.

Alternatively, immediately below the search bar are some shortcuts: buttons with icons identifying the most popular dishes in Rome. Simply click on the desired dish to start the search

Before starting the search it is possible to set a number of filters, in fact in the 'Filters' section the following filters are available:
  - vegan options
  - payment by card
  - accessibility for users with reduced mobility 
  - the price range
  - the average ratings of the restaurants
  - the neighborhood
  - the distance with respect to the user's geolocation
  - whether the restaurants are mentioned by food guides


#### Ranking

Once you choose the desired dish and filters you land on the new page that shows the top five restaurants with respect to the calculated ranking.
The restaurants are sorted in descending order by ranking, with a maximum score of 1 and a maximum score of 10.
For each restaurant, clicking shows the geolocation, references and price range.

For a more comprehensive detail of the restaurant simply click on the restaurant name and you will be redirected to the **'Restaurant detail** section.

#### Restaurant details

In fact, there is a brief description of the restaurant, some aggregate information, such as the number of users who have rated the restaurant fantastic.
Finally, possible places of interest near the restaurant can be displayed on the map.

This allows you to organize not only a lunch or dinner, but more generally a small tour focused on the city's gastronomic offerings.
