# **The App**
## The idea

The 'CraveIT' app has been designed to identify restaurants that are most loved for the traditional food they serve. 
In particular, users can find where to get the perfect carbonara in Rome! 
Users can log in, decide what they want to eat, and based on their selected dish, **the best restaurants will be recommended!**


<br>
## How the app works
----
CraveIT allows you to select a dish from the traditional Roman cuisine and recommends the best restaurants based on your chosen dish. Additionally, you can set a series of filters for a more personalized response.
The recommended results are based on the app’s **AI-powered ranking system**; its custom algorithm considers **several factors**, including customers’ feedback, experts’ opinions, the restaurants’ popularity, reliability and consistency over time.

### Overview

CraveIT displays a simple overview page where you can **search for the dish** you want to try. Type the dish in the search bar and the app will suggest its full name.
Can’t think of anything in particular? No worries, right below the search bar there are some buttons with icons identifying **the most popular** dishes in Rome. Click on what gets your attention!
You can also set a series of **filters** such as:
-  	vegetarians and vegan options;
-  	payment by credit card;
- 	accessibility for users with reduced mobility;
- 	price range;
-  	average ratings of the restaurants;
-  	neighborhood;
- 	distance to the user’s geolocation;
-  	presence in food guides.

### Ranking

Once you have chosen your desired dish and filters, you land on a new page that shows you the **top ten restaurants** selected by the ranking algorithm. The restaurants are sorted in descending order based on their **CraveIT score**, relative to your target dish, which ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 10.
<br>
<br>
Additionally, by clicking on the **drop-down menu** next to the restaurant's name, the app show its CraveIT score, address, phone number, and price range; furthermore, a map at the bottom of the box will display its geolocation.

It includes a brief description of the restaurant, its geolocation, and further information such as the number of users who have rated your target dish as excellent.
