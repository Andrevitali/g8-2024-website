# **The App**
## The idea

The 'CraveIT' app has been designed to identify restaurants that are most loved for the traditional food they serve. 
In particular, users can find where to get the most beloved carbonara in Rome! 
Users can log in, decide what they want to eat, and based on their selected dish, the best restaurants will be recommended!


## How the app works

CraveIT lets you select a dish from the traditional Roman cuisine and recommends the best restaurants based on your chosen dish. Additionally, you can set a series of filters for a more personalized response.

The recommended results are based on the app's ranking algorithm that considers several factors, including customer feedback, expert opinions, restaurant reliability, and the specialization of the analyzed restaurants.


#### Overview

'CraveIT' presents a simple overview page where you can search for the dish you want to try, just type the dish in the search bar and the app will suggest the full name of the dish.

Alternatively, immediately below the search bar are some shortcuts: buttons with icons identifying the most popular dishes in Rome. Simply click on the desired dish to start the search.

Before starting the search you can set a series of filters. In the 'Filters' section the following options are available:
  - Vegan options
  - Payment by card
  - Accessibility for users with reduced mobility 
  - Price range
  - Average ratings of the restaurants
  - Neighborhood
  - Distance with respect to the user's geolocation
  - Presence in food guides


#### Ranking

Once you have chosen your desired dish and filters, you land on a new page that shows you the top ten restaurants ordered in the ranking calculated by the algorithm.
The restaurants are sorted in descending order, with a minimum score of 1 and a maximum score of 10.
For each restaurant, its geolocation is shown.

For more comprehensive information on the restaurant, simply click on the restaurant's name and you will be redirected to the **'Restaurant detail** section.


#### Restaurant details

The restaurant detail page provides an overview of the restaurant's offerings. It includes a brief description of the restaurant and aggregate information, such as the number of users who have rated the restaurant as excellent. 
In addition, nearby places of interest can be displayed on the map.

This feature allows you to organize not only a lunch or dinner but also a small tour focused on the city's gastronomic offerings.



#### Navigation 


After you set the filters, click on the button for your chosen dish or select the dish from the search bar. 
Once the selection is made, you will be directed to the ranking page for that dish. Here, you can select a restaurant, view its details, or go back and start a new search.
