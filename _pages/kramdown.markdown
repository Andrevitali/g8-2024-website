CraveIT does something that **no other app does**: a restaurant ranking that is specifically based on the quality of a particular dish; this, of course, is a result we cherish. On the other hand, it poses a problem: it’s an **unsupervised process** for the validation of which we have no obvious label. We don’t <i>know</i> what is the correct result that our ranking is supposed to return.
<br>
Therefore, in order to **validate our results**, we have scoured the web in search of newspapers, magazines, and food blogs articles that had compiled a specific list of “<i>The best places to eat a x in Rome</i>”. The outcome took us by surprise.
